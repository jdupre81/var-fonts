🎨 **Variable Fonts Animation Project**
Project Overview

This project was originally developed in 2022 as part of my CAS studies at the Zurich University of the Arts (ZHdK).
The initial goal was to experiment with variable fonts and typographic animations.

What began as an academic exercise later evolved into a website for my father’s printing business.
Although the live website has since been redesigned, I decided to preserve the original design and source code in this repository as a reference and showcase of the concept.
